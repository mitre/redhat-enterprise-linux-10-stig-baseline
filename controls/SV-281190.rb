  desc 'Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password is, the greater the number of possible combinations that must be tested before the password is compromised.

Requiring digits makes password guessing attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger search space.'

Check the value for "dcredit" with the following command:

$ sudo grep -s dcredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf

If the value of "dcredit" is a positive number or is commented out, this is a finding.'
